"Today, we shine the PSI spotlight on Federal Civilian Sector Growth Analyst Amanda Ellison, who recently celebrated her first anniversary with the company!
 
Q. What is something that most people don’t know about you?
A. I’m an animal lover and make a point of always carrying a dog leash or rope and treats around in my car in the hope that I come across a stray or injured animal in need of help. I have regularly come home with a stray dog found wandering around, much to my husband’s dismay.
 
Q. What do you love most about your job?
A. Since joining Bill Niemeyer’s team in 2022, I have enjoyed and loved every aspect of my role. No two days are the same. The team that I joined are an amazing group of people who each bring their own level of knowledge and uniqueness to our sector. This has been instrumental to my development within my role and has enhanced my journey into Business Development.
 
Q. What's your professional success story?
A. I spent 15 years in the UK financial sector, starting out as a 20-year-old and moving from the grass roots into managing my own branch. During that time, I won several awards but the most satisfying of them was “outstanding branch performance” due to sales performance and customer feedback. 
 
Q. What challenges have you faced in your career?
A. I moved to the US from the UK in 2017 with my husband and daughter. In 2021, we were granted our green cards, allowing me to look for a job for the first time in five years. Despite all my qualifications and experience, I struggled to even get an interview. I circulated my resume and one day, Bill reached out to me and the rest, as they say, is history. At 52 years of age, embarking into a new industry with no prior background in Business Development was daunting but I knew I had many transferable skills that I could bring to the company.
 
Q. What was the toughest challenge you’ve experienced at work?
A. Making the decision at 36 years old to leave my full-time job and get my bachelor’s degree in business management.
 
Q. Who are your biggest inspirations at PSI?
A. Bill Niemeyer consistently demonstrates high standards of professionalism, work ethic and integrity. He fosters a strong positive and inclusive working culture where open communication is welcomed and encouraged.
 
Bill Stanley has a wealth of knowledge and experience within business development and working with federal agencies.
 
Richard Macon has been a great mentor! He has provided constructive insight and shared his knowledge and expertise within the business sector.
 
Carrie Donat has been a great mentor outside my immediate team. She has offered guidance and resources to allow me to grow and develop within my role.
 
I could go on and on, as many people within PSI have provided different forms of inspiration. It's a great company to work for!

""The collection of local municipalities, state and federal government organizations, high schools and higher education, with job placement organizations wrapped in local businesses and employers, allows for collaborative conversations and partnerships to form that not only extend business relationships but bring us closer as a community. This year's TeCMEN Industry Day was topped off with a great set of informative panels and a great Keynote Address by Col David Hoffman, Commander, 96th Cyberspace Test Group, Eglin Air Force Base.

HIMSS reflections from our CTO, Eric Skiff:
“One area I’m keeping an eye on is AIOps. I think now that we’re comfortable in the cloud and have put observability solutions in place, we’re going to have to apply AI to make sense of/use of all the data collected in metrics, events, logs, and traces. I also would like to see AI applied to vulnerability management (threat detection based on user behavior and event analytics, reducing false positives, and context-based vulnerability scoring to assist with remediation prioritization).”

"In honor of National Volunteer Week, we celebrate employees like Subcontracts Specialist Kathleen (Kate) Walker, who has a heart for selflessly giving back and serving in her community. Check out her Q&A and thanks for inspiring us, Kate! (Pictured below, on the right)

Q. How long have you volunteered with The Twig and what compelled you to do so? 
A. I've been a member of The Twig, the Junior Auxiliary of Inova Alexandria Hospital, for 18 years. I had been thinking about a way I could give back to our community for quite some time. I participated annually in the local annual breast cancer walk and noticed a group of ladies carrying a sign that read “The Twig” and was curious. At the end of our walk, we spoke with two ladies who told us all about the organization and its purpose. This was just the type of thing I was looking for, so I provided my contact information and was invited to their next membership event. At that event, I met so many wonderful ladies and learned more about The Twig and knew I wanted to be a part of the organization.

Q. What's the biggest personal benefit you receive as a Twig volunteer?
A. Seeing the faces of the hospital staff when we present them with a donation check, hand a check to a nursing scholarship winner, or acknowledge our nurses with flower flash mobs during National Nurses Week. 

Q. What's your favorite Twig memory? 
A. One of the moments that really resonates with me was during the COVID Pandemic. The Twig volunteers didn’t simply wait for the pandemic to be over. As soon as we were able to open our Thrift Shop again, we did. At the end of the year, we presented hospital staff with a $100,000 check to support the Inova COVID-19 Emergency Fund at Inova Alexandria Hospital. To see the expression on the faces of the doctors and nurses who were so dedicated to taking care of those who were sick with COVID was such a special moment.

Q. What do you wish more people knew about The Twig or what would you tell someone who is thinking about volunteering with The Twig?
A. There’s so much you can read on our website (www.thetwig.org), but this truly is an amazing organization. We’ve been supporting the hospital for 90 years and have gone from selling carnations on street corners to owning and operating a successful thrift shop in Old Town Alexandria and providing funding to update many areas of the hospital. 

Q. What advice would you give to someone considering volunteering at The Twig?
A. The ladies that make up The Twig all have their reasons for joining. We work hard but have fun doing it. Becoming a Twig is much more than just volunteering in a thrift shop for 2-3 hours/month. Before volunteering for any organization, think about what you want to get out of it. It’s a commitment, but one that you will be so glad you made.
